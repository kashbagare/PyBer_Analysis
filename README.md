# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analyis was to use our newly learned knowledge about Matploblib in order to graph data. This module also expands on the things we learned in the previous two modules such as working with data frames. In this challenge, we were asked to create a graph to visualize the differnces in the total fares by city type. 

## Results

### Total Rides

## Summary 
When looking at the graph, it is clear that Urban cities bring in more money than Suburban and Rural cities. From this, there are a couple things the CEO could do in order to increase revenues in Suburban and Rural areas. The first thing they can do is look at the costs for a ride in Suburban and Rural areas. Rides are much more expensive in these areas which is potentially a reason why the revenue is lower (people are less inclined to use PyBer because of the cost).
